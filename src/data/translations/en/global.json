        "paragraphTwo": "So, by the way, I am always open-minded to learn and explore every mystery. I would define myself as a person with high troubleshooting skills, and with a big capacity to adapt myself to almost any work, so I feel proud about that.",
        "paragraphThree": "Oh, I almost forgot, below you can see some of the technologies I have used to develop the challenging projects I mentioned earlier."
